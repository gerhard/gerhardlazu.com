It's not pretty and it's not using the app that I wanted, but I've been sitting on this blog long enough. I just want to write about my development stuff and the quickest way from A to B will have to do - for now.

This new blog is powered by "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll, deployed via "git-deploy":http://github.com/mislav/git-deploy. I've been in the Ruby world long enough to know how much better it is than - *sigh* - PHP. I just wanted to manage everything via Textmate, do version control with git and do quick deploys without messing with FTP. When I write a new post, I just do @cap deploy@ and all is taken care of.

I still have a long way to go before I reach the same level of beauty as "Peepcode's blog":http://blog.peepcode.com/tutorials/2010/about-this-blog, but for now I just want to offload all the day-in day-out development stuff.
