p(meta). Textpattern custom fields plugin gets better

I wanted to release this new version around Christmas time, but I've put some extra care and attention into it, it's the best release ever.

A lot of you have been asking for scripts to populate the values which appear under custom fields in the Write tab, this release makes that possible.
