title: glz_custom_fields v1.2.4 released
---

h1. {{ page.title }} &laquo; <span class="date">{{ page.date | date_to_string }}</span>

I wanted to release this new version around Christmas time, but I've put some extra care and attention into it, it's the best release ever. Besides some bugs which have been fixed and some general improvements, there are two big additions to this version:

h2. Custom field values from script

p. A lot of you have been asking for scripts to populate the values which appear under custom fields in the Write tab, this release makes that possible.

h2. Time Picker

p. The Date Picker field got a new friend, the Time Picker.
